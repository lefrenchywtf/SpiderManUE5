In this project, I will try to make Insomniac Games' Spider-Man movements, on Unreal Engine.
Starting with webswinging first, I will try to figure out how I can achieve the closest result to what the game has.
I will later implement crawling on walls as well as wallrunning.
After that we will have a good combinaison of all the above, with good transitions with animations.
